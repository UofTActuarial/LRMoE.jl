# LRMoE Package

**LRMoE** is a package tailor-made for actuarial applications which allows actuarial researchers and practitioners to model and analyze insurance loss frequencies and severities using the Logit-weighted Reduced Mixture-of-Experts (LRMoE) model. The flexibility of LRMoE models is theoretically justified in [Fung et al. (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167668719303956), and an application of LRMoE for modelling correlated insurance claim frequencies is in [Fung et al. (2019)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/astin-bulletin-journal-of-the-iaa/article/class-of-mixture-of-experts-models-for-general-insurance-application-to-correlated-claim-frequencies/E9FCCAD03E68C3908008448B806BAF8E).

The package **LRMoE** offers several new distinctive features which are motivated by various actuarial applications and mostly cannot be achieved using existing packages for mixture models. Key features include:
* A wider coverage on frequency and severity distributions and their zero inflation;
* The flexibility to vary classes of distributions across components;
* Parameter estimation under data censoring and truncation;
* A collection of insurance rate making and reserving functions; and
* Model selection and visualization tools.

While *LRMoE* was initially developed for actuarial application, this package also allows for customized expert functions for various modelling problems outside of the insurance context. For more details, see here.
